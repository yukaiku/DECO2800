A loading screen has been implemented to display to users while the textures and assets in the game are loaded. 

Additionally, progress indicators have been provided in order to provide the user with a purpose for waiting: user feedback during play testing indicated that with the long loading times, some users were uncertain whether the game was actually loading or whether it was experiencing errors; by introducing a loading screen, users are reassured that the game is working as intended, which improves the player experience.
