The main menu of the game has been designed to let users start a new game, as well as alter the settings and quit the game.

In order to improve the "juiciness" of the main menu, a sound is played and the colour of the button is changed when the player mouses over each button.

This is in response to feedback that it was at times unclear whether the correct button was selected; by providing a clear visual and audio indication, the engagement of players with the main menu was increased. Users generally rated this feature highly during testing, which may have been because users valued immediate feedback when selecting a button.
