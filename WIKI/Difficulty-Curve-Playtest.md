- Number of people interviewed: 5
- Result of Player Hp: 
    - Some of the players felt that the player HP should be increasing as the game progress, as it would give them a sense of fulfilment to encourage them to progress more into the game. However due to the difficulty of the game in itself, whereby the player is restricted currently to a maximum of 100hp, having a curve towards 100hp would lead it to an almost impossible winning situation in the first few stages, hence a majority vote in the HP staying as 100.
- Result of enemy Hp:
    - Most of the player felt that the enemy was fairly easy to kill and had no issue with the way it was currently set at and the added bonus of the additional damage based on what the character picked at the start, made an interesting element to the game. Hence HP of the enemy will stay tweaked to how it is currently.
- Result of boss:
    - Similar to the enemy, the players felt that based on the map it is on and obstacles there were around the boss, the HP currently set for the boss is suitable.
- Result of spawn cap and rate of the enemy:
    - Taking into account enemy does not include special goblins, the current spawn cap and rate is hardly noticeable hence, is okay to stay the same, however one noted that as skills had cooldown and the rate of spawn for goblins are quite fast, the cap of the first stage should be set lower than the others.
- Result of skills damage and cooldown:
    - Based on the feedback during gameplay, the players were satisfied with the current damage output done to the enemies and also noted that it was interesting when additional damage was done to the enemy for specific skills, hence this surprise element of skills damage will be kept the same. However, the cooldown of the skills will be the same throughout as it impacts the players learning curve. Players will take time to learn new skills and get used to it and having a different cooldown based on stages would impact their gameplay.
