**Introduction**

The puzzles will be completed by the player in a puzzle room, this page will contain the design of each puzzle. The puzzle will be provide the player a gift of some kind should it be successfully completed.

_**Version 1**_

**Swamp Zone/Puzzle 1**

In the puzzle room there will be 3 "columns" (object) that will glow one by one in a random order for a total of 7 times. The player will have to "interact" with the columns in that exact same order to successfully clear the puzzle. 
E.g. "A, B, C, B, B, A, C"

**Tundra Zone/Puzzle 2**

A logic puzzle, "A warlock and a demon play scissors-paper-rock 10 times, the warlock uses 3xR, 6xS and 1xP, the demon uses 2xR, 4xS and 4xP. They never tied and the order of the game is unknown, who wins?"

**Desert Zone/Puzzle 3**

An "orc" appears and attack the player, however this orc is special it hurts itself whenever it attacks and gets healed whenever it takes damage, the player doesn't know this and must figure it out on their own. They do receive a hint though "Ying becomes Yang and Yang becomes Ying" or "Life becomes death and death becomes life". When the "orc" is dead the puzzle has been successfully completed.

**Volcano Zone/Puzzle 4**

There are three "doors" (portals), the middle one is safe but the player will get nothing from it, the other two doors however are different. One of them will provide the player a "gift" (gold) the other will provide the player a "negative" (lose 50% of health), which one is which is indistinguishable. Basically flip a coin could be bad, could be good, or play it safe. 

_**Version 2**_ 

Changes made based on user testing

The third puzzle was made to fit the theme of the game better so that the cohesiveness isn't lost. The first and second puzzle was left alone as the user's had no issues or negative comments for them. The fourth puzzle was changed to not be random chance but instead a riddle. The idea of 3 choices however was kept with instead a way of choosing the "good" out of the 3 options.

All the users found the 2nd puzzle was rather difficult rating it 8,9,8,7,7 however they did not want the difficulty reduced as they thought it was a fun brain teaser. There were 2 user's that preferred the life/death line over the ying/yang line saying that "it suits the western fantasy theme better". They also found this puzzle slightly more difficult but still solvable rating it 5,6,7,6,6. The users disliked the 4th puzzle stating that it was more of a flip of a coin and not a puzzle and 1 user suggested giving them 3 different objects to choose from with 1 being good and 2 being bad with a hint to suggest which one is good.
