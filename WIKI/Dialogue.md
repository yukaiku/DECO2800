**Version 5.0**

The plot at the beginning did not explain why the orbs were needed just that they were the objective, this caused the tested users to feel the objective was lackluster and just an arbitrary win condition. The individualism and uniqueness of each zone and boss should be further upheld as the user found this repetitive so each boss was given its own name to make it more unique and not just name after the zone it is in. The noise made by the enemies was found to be boring and not unique to the monster itself so blurbs tied to the enemies character have been made.   

Tutorial Dialogues

- Greetings my students, you both must save the world of Decodia by defeating the elder dragons and collecting the orbs they have stolen. These orbs contain the great power of the elements and without them the world is out of balance. You will have to use your combined powers of steel and magic to prevail against the looming terrors.

**User Testing**
Each dialogue was read by a user and questioned for their experience and opinion on each blurb and overall theme.

1. Do you enjoy the fantasy genre?
2. Do you find the blurbs repetitive?
3. Do you find the blurbs out of place of the game?
4. Do you find the blurbs inappropriate?
5. Do you understand what the blurbs mean?
6. Any suggestions on a blurb/s? 

**Evaluation**
There were 5 interviewees, 4 of them enjoyed the fantasy genre. There were 3 participants that found the beginning of the plot to be questionable asking "So does the orb do anything?". The other two didn't care about the plot and just wanted to know the objective of the game. Due to this the beginning was kept short and clear while explaining everything involving the user's purpose. One of the user's pointed out that goblins don't really roar and that orcs can usually speak. This led to more stereotypical phrases the enemies could use while being short as it should only be appearing for a moment meaning the user will only have a short time to read it. Most of the participants didn't find the blurb repetitive with 1 participant actually liking the repetitive parts. This was due to it making the game seem more uniform. None of the users found the blurbs out of place or difficult to understand.
