# Swamp Elements Research  
I did a research to find out more about the swamp in the forests. Swamps are wet areas in the forests where the death plants are growing at. Common plants found in swamps are: mosses, fungus, swamp trees, bogs, and etc.

Next, I did some research on the design drawings of swamp elements.

Based on the research, I decided the primary colours for the swamp boss health bar will brownish-green and medium brown.

# **Design Progress**  
The design of the boss health bar was at first drawn based on the research I have done. However, I’m afraid my version one design cannot depicts clearly that this it is the boss’s health bar. In other words, there is no element in the design of version 1 that can directly express that “this is the health bar of the boss dragon”. Hence, I made a change to the version 1 design which I use the boss dragon’ avatar to depicts clearly.

Initial Sketch:

Both version 1 and version 2 will be taken for user testing along with the other bosses’ health bar design.

# **Design Polish**
We have been informed from the enemies team that the design for the swamp boss has been changed. In order to be consistent to match its health bar, the design for the swamp boss health bar was also decided to change. Sprites for the swamp boss health bar were made according to the new design of the swamp boss.
