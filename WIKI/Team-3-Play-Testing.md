## Play Testing - Overall Game Design
#### Conducted by Yuexuan Sheng 
After game completed, a play testing will be conducted to test the acceptance of the design concept. The participants who will be invited for testing are students outside our studio, and they will be given the game and asked few questions based on the it.
Play testing was done to find out which part of game should be improved. And the play test was done by online chatting with 4 interviews.

1, Do you think this game is easy to play?    
2, How long did you spend learning how to play?    
3, Does the tutorial and control seem confusing?    
4, How long did you finish the game?    
5, Did the game feel too long or too short, or just right?    
6, Do you have other advice for this game?    


Answer
1, Yes. 2, Just 5 mins after finishing the tutorial. 3, No, it’s very clear. 4, One level takes me 4-7mins, to finish the game is 20mis. 5, Just right. 6, I think some dialog boxes should be big. 

1, Yes. 2, from tutorial. 3, No. 4, It’s 15 mins. 5, Just right. 6, If we can add automatic attack, that will be perfect.

1, Yes. 2, After I kill three Goblins. 4, 20mins. 5, It’s a bit long, maybe 3 environments is enough. 6, Too many Goblins to kill, if you must have four environments to test, randomly appear in three from four environment maps

1,Yes. 2, 3mins after the tutorial. 3, it is  clear to get some information. 4, about 15 mins. 5.it is good. 6, NO



Through the user test, all four respondents think the game is easy to play, and the tutorial is very clear to check. And they can finish the game around 15-20 mins.
Most of interviewees think that the game duration is just right, in order to meet the needs of most people, such a game setting is just right.

## Play Testing 2 - Focus upon NPCs & Items 
#### Conducted by Arshia Sharma 

This second type of testing intended to gauge how testers interacted with items, NPCs in the game. The distinction between the testing done in this sprint and the other three sprints were just focused on testing in isolation the proposed changes for that specific sprint. This testing encompassed all implementations of the NPCs and items. Play testing was conducted over Zoom. 

No explicit questions were asked; instead, the testers were simply observed as they played the game. To make sure the focus was on NPCs and Items, a condition was added that on each level, players must interact with one item and an NPC. 

#### Observations 
NPC dialogues were not used often. The NPC most often interacted with was the tutorial NPC. This was probably due to the novelty factor. With other worlds, testers often remarked about the design of the NPCs. They also appreciated the heal option that the NPCs provided much more than the dialogue. 

The most used item was the health potion; testers were eager to buy a health potion as soon as they lost some health. Treasure chests were also used often; however, most testers were confused as to what they did because no message nor animation was provided. I usually had to step in and inform them that their GP had increased.
