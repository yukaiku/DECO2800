# ***Sound Design***
Sound design for Polyhedron was contributed to by two teams, the Combat team and the Enemy / Animation team. 

## Early Design
The initial sound design for this project consisted of using recordings of nature, and layering these to create ambience tracks. These were assembled together to form seamless loops which were then played on repeat through the level. Additionally, a short song was composed and recorded on guitar for the menu.

### Early Design Feedback
After adding the early sound design tracks to the project, a small sample size of user testing was undertaken.

***Process:***
1) Testers were instructed to play test the game, paying attention to how the ambience and music tracks suited the style of the game. (In particular, the Medieval theme, and realism levels of the graphics).
2) Testers were asked to provide written anonymous feedback in response to some closed, and open ended questions:
a) Did the ambience of the game suit the graphical theme, and game genre?
b) In what way did the ambience support, or not support, the style of the game?
c) Did the ambience and music invoke any emotional response towards the game?
d) Do you have any suggestions (please provide references where possible) of how the ambience may be improved?

***Results:***

The response to the user testing was that the ambience did not provide any emotional response to the game, as it was too calm and in the background. This was particularly noted that it felt uncomfortable to fight bosses with the soothing sounds of crickets in the background. A number of suggested references to games with dark and heavy ambience was provided.

## Final Design
The final design were created by using droning and ominous synths. Each sound track was designed to mimic the zone that was intended to be played in, and the stage of the game.

### Swamp World
This sound track was designed to imitate the sound of rain and insects, whilst still providing a dark atmosphere. The track is laid back as it is an early part of the game.

### Tundra World
This track was difficult, as snow and ice based environments are well known for being quiet landscapes. The resulting track was an attempt to remain peaceful, and quiet, but with influences from glacial collapsing ice.

### Desert World
This track begins an attempt to bring tension into the game, by adding faster elements to the audio. The inspiration for this track was insects, and the didgeridoo.

### Volcano World
This track is played through the most intense level of the game, and is inspired by the loud eruptions you would find near active volcanos. Additionally, the constant crackle that is intended to mimic the sound of burning as lava interacts with the world around it. To bring tension into this sound track, a constant ticking is played through the whole track.

## Final Feedback
Unfortunately due to time constraints, no user testing was performed on the new sound track. However, during play tests the identified weaknesses of the early designs appear to have been resolved.

### Boss Sounds

From the Enemies team, boss music and SFX (roars/growls) was integrated into the existing SoundManager. This was in response to play test feedback that user engagement may be increased if sounds are played during boss fights.

In order to change the music from the general ambience noises and to increase the tension of boss battles, an active boss music BGM was implemented once the dragon boss fight has begun. Additionally, in order to further increase the tension of boss fights and increase the juiciness of the game, dragon roars and growls were implemented to act as SFX making the dragons more threatening.
