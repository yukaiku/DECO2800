**Entities/PlayerPeon.java**
- This is stored in a map of string to string located in the Entities/PlayerPeon.java called dialogues
- getDialogue(Stringtarget): This method returns the string depending on the value of the target. Changed from using a list to make getting the desired dialogue easier.
e.g. if getDialogue("fire") is called it will return the dialogue for the pyro wizard.
