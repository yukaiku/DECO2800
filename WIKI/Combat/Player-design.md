**User Testing**
According to the game design plan, when the player picks up armor, the player's mech will also be updated to look like armor. User testing is done after users have actually experienced the game. Instead of the previous A/B testing. After the feedback from user testing, the playerâ€™s mech is too close to the original mech style, which can make the mech look more special. This can give the player a stronger visual effect, which makes a big difference after having armor.

**Walking Animation Sprint3**

**User Testing Sprint3**

After showing the animation to users, got a few concentrated feedback from the users. The player walks is like a spider. As the walking posture changes, the player's body will also have a tendency to move up and down, which is consistent with normal sports behavior. But considering the game style, this way of walking is a bit more high-tech and will deviate from the game style requirements. Therefore, it is possible to cancel the movement of the player's mechanical legs in the future sprint, and only let the upper part of the mech has a movement animation.

**User Testing**

Users choose one of the design patterns and give suggestions. The second wizard will be more popular and fit the style of the game. Some users indicated that the first one is more like Santa Claus instead of a wizard.

#### **User testing**

A total of 8 participants conducted user tests. These users all like games and often play games. User testing is done by giving users two different design patterns, allowing them to choose and asking some questions.  

1. Two design textures of wizards, which one is your favorite one?
2. Do you think the pattern and colour of wizards fit the theme of the game? Please explain. 
3. Do you like the wizard attack skills? Can you explain the reason if you don't like it? 
4. What kind of attack skill do you look forward to most?
5. If you make suggestions, what do you think needs to be improved?
