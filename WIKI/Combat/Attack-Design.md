# **Description** 

Polyhedron is composed of knights and wizards. During the game, players choose different knights and wizards to determine different fighting styles. The knight is responsible for melee attack and defense by using weapons such as swords, while wizards give the mechs the ability to attack enemies at a distance.

# **Polyhedron Attack Design Process** 

The current combat mode is divided into two types. One is a close-range attack, which has stronger attack power. The other is a long-range attack, which can attack enemies within a certain radius. Players can move in four directions. After discussing with the designer of the enemy group, all players and enemies only have textures on the left and right, which means that the upward and downward movement of characters will face left or right.

#### **User Testing**
Two kinds of attack animations are shown to users. If it is used as an attack effect alone, the overall color is brighter, which is consistent with the normal attack design. However, if the green textures are compared with the swamp zone, the colors of the two are relatively close, which is easy to be ignored by users in the process of user experience. So according to users' suggestions, can adjust the color of the first picture in the future sprint, maybe change to a color that is opposite to green. At the same time, more users choose option A. Healing skill is more special in the game compare with option B.

1. Do you think this can be used as an attack animation for the game?
2. Do you like the current design pattern? Please Explain.
3. Do you think textures colors are consistent with the game map?
4. Are there any suggestions to improve the current design?

Taking into account the medieval style, there are mainly metal, wood, cross, knight and other elements. The original design has been re-modified, adding wood elements.

#### **Version2.0-08/31/2020**

By collecting user feedback, this design looks too robotic, does not meet the requirements of the medieval game style, and there is no way to show the role of the knight well. At the same time, the color of the character will be a bit close to the environment. In order to better distinguish players, the design needs to be adjusted.

#### **Version1.0-08/17/2020**
After user testing, this design does not conform to the current game theme. The game requires the knight to pilot the mech to fight. However, this initial design did not highlight the mecha part.

#### **User Testing**
After drawing the design texture, I chose a face-to-face interview method for user experience testing. The content of the user questionnaire is 

1. Do you like to play games?
2. Have you played medieval games and action games before?
3. Out of the three design types, which do you prefer? Please explain.
4. Is this art style suitable for medieval games?
5. Where do you think this design needs to be improved? Please explain.
