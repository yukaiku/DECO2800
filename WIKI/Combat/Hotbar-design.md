#### **User Testing**

After completing the second version, both are shown to users. Based on the feedback from users after testing, users choose version2.0. Because the diagonal line in the second version has a movement trend. It looks more like a dynamic attacking skill and can stimulate users' interest in trying different skills.

User testing is done by showing pictures to users. Users answer questions and give their options on the content of the design. The specific questions are as follows:

1. If you make a choice, which one will you choose? Please Explain. 
2. Do you think the design of skill textures are consistent with Hotbar?
3. If you see skill icons, can you know what skill it is?
4. What do you think needs to be improved in future design?

**User Testing**

Through users feedback, users can correctly understand the player's current skill state. At the same time, users also pointed out that the design interface is relatively simple. Maybe the design pattern will be adjusted in the future sprint and other totems will be added to the original design.
