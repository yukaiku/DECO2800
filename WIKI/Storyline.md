**Tutorial**

The tutorial will be a guide to play/complete the game. This will be an option to be selected at the main menu of the game. The player will see a dialogue box with instructions on moving to a "flag" with the key binds required to do so. A dummy monster will appear and a dialogue box with instructions on attack key binds and commands to kill the dummy monster. After killing the monster a fake orb will appear with instructions to pick/interact with it. Then the player will be sent to a single player game as if they had clicked the single player option first in the menu.
