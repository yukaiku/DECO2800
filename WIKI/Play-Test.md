# **Description**
Play tests have been done with multiple testers to test their overall player experience to play the entire game. The purpose of this page is to show the guide for the play test and the results. The tests are either done on Zoom, which the testers are asked to share their screen, or face-to-face interview. Observation is done by monitoring the testers to play the game on site.

# **Test Guide**
**Purpose of the Test**<br/>
The purpose of this play test is to find out the game logic flow, difficulty level, creativity, and most importantly, the overall experience of the game. <br/>

5. Kill the boss and collect the orb.<br/>
6. Continue the game to the next few zones and do you best to collect all 4 orbs.<br/>

**Observation:**<br/>
While testers are playing the game, observe their behavior towards the game.

**Qualitative Questions**<br/>
1. How does the tutorial room or NPCs help you to have a better experience to play this game?<br/>
2. You noticed that you have two team options to choose from with different powers and skills they have, which team do you like more? Why?<br/>
3. Which part of the game do you think is most attractive to you? Why?<br/>
4. Are there any parts of the game you think should be improved?<br/>
5. Will you continue to play this game in the future?<br/>

# **Result Evaluation**
From the feedback I received after the play tests (see transcripts below from Reference), the testers all agree that the game is difficult to complete all levels. From the observation I did, the furthest the testers can play until is level 3, which is the desert zone. All testers agree that the tundra zone is terrible due to the boss's attack which they got frozen and cannot move at all. While being frozen, the enemies continue to spawn and the second waves of the boss's attack also keep coming. The testers feel that 
it is impossible to complete the tundra zone. One of the tester also passed the the tundra level because he chose the fire team, which can cause higher attack in the tundra map. All testers also agree that the water team is useless due to the cooldown time of the long range skill, and the melee attack could not protect that much from the attacks due to the fast spawning rate of the enemies. They all suggested that to reduce the spawning rate of the enemies.

### **A. Transcript for Mr. T**
**1. How does the tutorial room or NPCs help you to have a better experience to play this game?**<br/>
NPC are useless because they're situated or the way at the back And I didn't even know they existed until you to told me. If you want the user to interact with the NPCs, The programmers will have to make them visible out right and also I’m not so far away from the boss . Also the NPC looks very out of place Because they look just like any other things in the map that’s very blending am I thought I just obstacles on the map or something.<br/>
**2. You noticed that you have two team options to choose from with different powers and skills they have, which team do you like more? Why?**<br/>
I definitely like the fire team because the skills that the water team has are not very useful. If you do it slow down the Enemies but the speed for spawning the enemies was also quite fast. There were too many enemies on the map and too many things just happened together so it's very messy. Slowing down the enemy is quite cool but the cool down for the skills was also quite long. It doesn't make sense to me or there must be a reason why they've put the cooldown longer.<br/>
**3. Which part of the game do you like? Why?**<br/>
I would say the animations of the skills and the player animation. I also like the dragon, which is the boss, is bigger than the rest of the enemies so that it tells me it is the boss. <br/>
**4. Are there any parts of the game you think should be improved?**<br/>
I really want the players to be pushed back when the melee attack for the fire team was triggered. Because it was hard for me to get close the enemies in order to fire the melee and I had to run away quickly, but I couldn't, my health got minus because there were so many enemies around me. Also, the soundtrack of the game is quite annoying, I just feel that they are pretentious in the game.<br/>
Another thing I am very frustrated about is the desert zone. There are just too many obstacles around and they are so near to each other and I lose health when I get near to the cactuses. I hate it so much.I don’t know where to stand at all. It’s not a matter of whether it is difficult or not, It’s the matter of the hit radius, like the SphereCast radius, they're gonna make an adjustment for them. Either put obstacles more far away from each other, or reduce the amount of obstacles in the desert zone, because it is just ridiculous.<br/>
**5. Will you continue to play this game in the future?**<br/>
No

### **B. Transcript for Mr. C**
**1. How does the tutorial room or NPCs help you to have a better experience to play this game?**<br/>
Honestly, I did not pay attention of what the NPC said in the game. I did not even notice they are NPCs until you give me some hints. I feel that the NPCs are quite useless because I can still explore the game, like what I should do in the game along playing. The NPCs doesn't really give me any valuable information. The tutorial room is fine, at least I learned the player's control from the tutorial room.<br/>
**2. You noticed that you have two team options to choose from with different powers and skills they have, which team do you like more? Why?**<br/>
Definitely the fire team. I can feel a lot of difference after playing both teams. I think is because the cooldown time for the fire team is lesser, that's why I feel that the attack speed for fire team is faster. Also, the skills for the water team is useless at all. Not only the skills' cooldown time is longer, the melee attack also does not protect me that much or longer because there were too many enemies spawned. The calculation for the time difference between the cooldown time and the time for spawning the enemies should be balanced. I feel that the time to spawn the enemies is much more quicker than my cooldown time. <br/>
**3. Which part of the game do you like? Why?**<br/>
I only like the playing mode of this game. Like the concept of the game is to kill enemies, and kill the big boss to collect the orb. It somewhat brings up my desire of challenging the game.<br/>
**4. Are there any parts of the game you think should be improved?**<br/>
Again, the calculation of the time difference between the spawning rate for the enemies and cooldown time for the player's skills should make an adjustment. I feel like this is the most important part because it is the key to decide whether a player can complete the game. The game right now almost feel like it is impossible to complete all the levels to collect the orbs. Especially in the tundra zone, I could move at all after I got frozen from the boss attack, and I have been keep frozen because there is no time for me to unfreeze since the boss attack keep coming. Plus the enemies spawning rate was very fast too, there's no chance for me to escape. If you could make a change for the calculation, at least let the player feel that there is a way to complete all levels, I think the quality of the game will go up to another level.<br/>
**5. Will you continue to play this game in the future?**<br/>
Yes. As long as if the game is modified to give me the feeling that "I am able to complete the levels".
