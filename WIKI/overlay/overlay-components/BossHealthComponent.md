In order to improve the juiciness of the boss health bar, a drop shadow effect was introduced, and color of the hp number has been changed to a flashing red when the dragon reaches a low health. This is to provide users a sense of satisfaction when they are able to reduce the health of the boss to a low number, through visual cues representative of common isomorphisms (red is commonly associated with low health in video games).
